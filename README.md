hi.  
i don’t know why this exists.  
i just made it because my brain wouldn’t shut up and i had to do *something* before i launched myself into the sun.  

this repository is not a joke. but also it is. but also it ruined my sleep schedule......


## what is this

a cry for help  
a tribute to thermodynamics  
maybe semantic guts ,   
maybe syntax shell, or 
maybe a sacrificial pipeline.

whatever it is, it’s mine.

## how to use

1. install the usual stuff. idk. you know what to do. if you don’t, you shouldn’t be here tbh.
   ```bash
   git clone this-mess.git
